Tencent Cloud's services can be quite expensive, so I've been on the hunt for a free alternative for hosting images for my blog.

You can post your images on CSDN and then copy the link provided below each image. Paste this link into your Markdown file, and you now have access to a FREE image hosting service—at least in theory.

As a humorous Chinese saying goes, "只能中午用，因为早晚会出事."

**Frustrated!** When I view this blog in the next morning, the picture is banned. However, I can preview this link(https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/0d2098105fde44478da70be69e423b7b.png) by Typora or a browser. This might be due to the anti-hotlinking mechanism of CSDN. Some websites use the HTTP Referer header to prevent their images from being referenced by other websites. If an HTTP request's Referer header is not within its allowed range, the server might refuse to return the image content.

**Anyway, the expericenle is immensely valuable.**
